# Seedforce
This repository contains scripts and functions for all the genetic analyses performed in pooled species in the framework of the Seedforce project
![stacks_de_novo_POOL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b14813f0-f510-4288-956d-cdfc617cfcbc)

Twenty-one species (Astragalus verrucosus (AVE), Bassia Saxicola (BSA), Campanula sabatia (CSA), Cytisus aeolicus )(CAE), Limonium strictissimum (LIS), Linum muelleri (Failed due to low number of reads), Ribes sardoum (RSA), Silene hicesiae (SHI), Adenophora liliifolia (ALI), Centranthus amazonum (Failed due to low number of raw reads), Crepis pusilla (CPU), Eleocharis carniolica (ECA), Gentiana ligustica (GLI), Gladiolus palustris (GPA), Himantoglossum adriaticum (HAD), Kosteletzkya pentacarpos (KOS), Leucojum nicaeense (ACI), Linaria pseudolaxiflora (LPS), Marsilea quadrifolia (MAQ), Woodwardia radicans (WOR) and Gladiolus illyricus (GIL) were sequenced following the procedure for the pool approach and DNA was extracted from 613 individuals that were included in 77 populations.
