Scripts and functions generated in the framework of SEEDFORCE project, financed by the LIFE program. They were used to analyze ddRAD sequencing data of Primula palinuri samples to obtain information on polymorphisms and genetic structure. 


USE

Follow the script a01_de_novo_pipeline_stacks.sh. The folder "functions" contains all the functions required to run the script. Other analyses are available in the scripts folder
