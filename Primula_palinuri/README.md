Scripts and functions generated in the framework of SEEDFORCE project, financed by the LIFE program. They were used to analyze ddRAD sequencing data of _Primula palinuri_ samples to obtain information on polymorphisms and genetic structure. 


USE

Follow the script a01_de_novo_pipeline_stacks.sh. The folder "functions" contains all the functions required to run the script. Other analyses are available in the scripts folder
